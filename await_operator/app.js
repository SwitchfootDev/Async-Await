// Native promise version:
function nativePromiseDinner() {
  brainstormDinner().then((meal) => {
	  console.log(`I'm going to make ${meal} for dinner.`);
  });
}

/* 
1.
Fill in the body of the announceDinner() function so that it has the same functionality as nativePromiseDinner(). It should wait for the promise returned from brainstormDinner() to resolve, and then log a string to the console in the same format as did nativePromiseDinner(). Youâ€™ll need to use the await operator inside your function. 

At the bottom of app.js, beneath the function declaration, invoke the announceDinner() function.
